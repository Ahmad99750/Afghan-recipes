      <p> You will love the colors in this beef shish kebab recipe. The brightness of the veggies against the darkness of the beef on a bed of hot white rice is just plain appetizing. And the marinade makes the beef tender, and delicious.</p>

      <p>In the Middle East, kebabs are not always prepared on a skewer and do not always consist of cubed meat and veggies.</p>

      <p>Since kebabs are prepared in just about every Middle Eastern country, there are several spellings, such as kabob, kebob, kebap, kabab, and kebab.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds beef sirloin, or beef tenderloin, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>

        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
 
        <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>

        <li>Red onion wedges, bell peppers, and mushrooms, optional</li>

    </ul>

     <h2>Steps to Make It</h2>
      <h3>Marinate the Beef</h3>
       <ol> 
         <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>

         <li>About 24 hours prior to grilling, prepare the marinade by combining olive oil, vinegar, cumin, coriander, paprika, and garlic.</li>
   

          <li>Pour marinade into a freezer bag and add beef cubes. Allow marinating in the refrigerator until ready to grill.</li></ol>

        <h3>Grill the Kebabs</h3>
         <ol> 
         <li> Remove beef from the refrigerator and thread meat onto metal skewers that have been sprayed with cooking oil. If using the optional vegetables, thread them onto separate skewers because they cook differently than the beef. Alternatively, you may also use wooden skewers which have been soaked in water for 30 minutes.</li>
  

          <li>Coat the grill grates with cooking oil to prevent sticking. Grill for 5 to 7 minutes on each side or until desired doneness.</li>
    

           <li>Serve kebabs on the skewers or off the skewers over a bed of white rice, with grilled veggies.</li> </ol>
