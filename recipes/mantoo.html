      <p>This Afghani dumpling recipe involves filling gow gee wrappers (or you can make your own pastry) with a meat and onion mixture, steaming them, then serving them with a split pea sauce and garlic yoghurt. It is truly delicious.</p>

       </ul>

       <li>2 onions, diced</li>
       <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
       <li>3 tomatoes, diced</li>
       <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
       <li>1 tsp salt</li>
       <li>3 tbsp oil </li>
       </ul>

       <strong>Topping for yoghurt</strong>
       <ul>
       <li>500 g plain yoghurt</li>
       <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Instructions</h2>

       <strong>Soaking time 2–3 hours</strong>
       <ol>
       <li>For the sauce, soak split peas for 2–3 hours or overnight. Heat oil in a frying pan and cook onion and garlic until lightly browned. Add tomato and tomato paste. Add split peas and ¾ cup water and cook for 30–45 minutes until soft. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.</li>
        <li>For the filling, heat oil in a frying pan. Add the mince and stir until golden brown. Add onion and cook until transparent, then add the coriander and pepper and mix through. Take pan off the heat and place mixture in a dish to cool. (Note: this mixture should have more onion than meat.)</li>
         <li>In a separate bowl mix yoghurt with garlic and salt to taste.</li>
         <li>If using square gow gee wrappers, place a spoonful of filling in the centre of each wrapper. Moisten edge of pastry squares with water. Lift corner to corner and seal, then wrap two corners of the triangle to seal in filling.</li>
          <li>For homemade pastry (see below), place a spoonful of filling in the center of the rolled-out dough. Dip finger in water and moisten the circumference of the pastry shape. Lift the outer rim to meet in the middle. Seal the edges by pressing together to form dumplings.</li>
          <li>Oil the base of steamer to prevent sticking and place dumplings carefully across oil. Steam for 25 minutes.</li>
          <li>Smear a fine layer of garlic yoghurt over base of two large serving plates. Place the dumplings in a circular decorative manner. Evenly drizzle the remaining yoghurt over the dumplings, followed by the split pea sauce. Scatter with dried mint and chilli powder.</li>
            </ol>

         <strong>•Note:</strong>

          <p>If you would like to make your own pastry, add 500g plain flour in a large mixing bowl and gradually add water, mixing with hands until it becomes doughy. Leave the dough to settle for 15–20 minutes or until it becomes firm. Separate dough into small handfuls and roll into individual ball shapes. Scatter some flour on the bench surface and using a small rolling pin, roll the balls into circular shapes.</p>
